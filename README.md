## About

The server project is to build a microblogging site. It should allow users to submit their own posts and view all the posts submitted by others. We decided to create a space to post secrets, that would be timestamped but anonymous, allowing the user to share all!

## Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the directory
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.

## User stories 

### Core 

- [ ] As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- [ ] As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted

### Stretch 

- [ ] As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

### Acceptance Criteria 

- [ ] Deployed to Fly.io
- [ ] A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- [ ] No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- [ ] No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- [ ] All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- [ ] Tests for each server route
- [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
