## User stories 

### Core 

- [ ] As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- [ ] As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted

### Stretch 

- [ ] As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

### Acceptance Criteria 

- [ ] Deployed to Fly.io
- [ ] A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- [ ] No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- [ ] No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- [ ] All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- [ ] Tests for each server route
- [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
